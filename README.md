This picture is a layout of the application when you first lanuch it, I will highlight the main features before going into another one

Starting from the top the first thing you will see is a triangle, after you click roll, a number randomly from 1-4 will be shown in the center of it. This is because you have not chosen a specific dice yet or an amount, so it will default to that.

Just below all of that is the roll button and clear total, the roll button will roll the selected dice once and show you the output. 

The clear total button will clear the total when it is on screen or not, this button will not be hidden in case if you want to clear it without it being visible.

Next up is the spinners, which is likely the more complicated part.

Spinner 1 the dice chooser, when you tap on this spinner it will show a list of dice you may choose from, going from d4-d100 standard dungeons and dragons dice. It will change the image and the bounds of the dice rolled.
Spinner 2 to the right of that one is the amount of dice you wish to roll at once, due to limitations with the screen size, you may only roll 4 dice at once without having problems with spacing so use that to your advantage if you need to roll 6 or more.

The last object is the switch, this switch will tell the program weither or not you want to add up all of the dice into one subtotal or an overall total, which we will get onto the next image.
